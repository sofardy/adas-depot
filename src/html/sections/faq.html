								<span class="faq__question-text">Do you offer financing?</span>

							</button>
							<div class="faq__answer">
								<p>
									Yes. We provide flexible financing options for auto repair shops, diagnostic businesses, and service
									centers of all sizes. Whether you're investing in the IA900 with integrated wheel alignment or the
									MA600 mobile ADAS system, our partners offer affordable monthly payment plans designed to align with
									your expected ROI and shop cash flow. This allows you to add ADAS calibration services without
									straining your capital budget.

								<span class="faq__question-text">Is installation included?</span>

							<div class="faq__answer">
								<p>
									Every system includes full setup assistance and calibration launch support. Our team helps with
									initial installation, configuration, and first calibrations—either via live remote guidance or
									optional on-site visits. From unboxing to the first target alignment, we make sure your ADAS equipment
									is operational and properly integrated with your workflow. Larger systems like the IA900 frame may
									benefit from guided shop layout planning, while mobile setups such as the MA600 kit are supported with
									rapid-deploy tutorials.

								<span class="faq__question-text">How much space do I need?</span>

							</button>
							<div class="faq__answer">
								<p>
									System requirements vary depending on the package you choose. For example, the Autel IA900 is ideal
									for shops with a dedicated calibration and alignment bay, while the IA700 offers more flexibility for
									mid-sized garages. The MA600 system is designed for mobile use or tight spaces like corner bays or
									shared service areas. Our specialists will assess your physical layout and recommend a solution that
									fits your space constraints.

							</button>
							<div class="faq__answer">
								<p>
									Most shops perform their first successful ADAS calibration within 1–2 training sessions. Thanks to
									Autel’s intuitive tablet interface (MS909 or MS Ultra) and our structured training program,
									technicians quickly become comfortable using the system. Features like camera-based target placement
									and automated pre-alignment checks streamline the process, even for first-time users. We also provide
									calibration workflow guides, video walk-throughs, and ongoing support to help your team build
									confidence fast.

							</button>
							<div class="faq__answer">
								<p>
									No ongoing subscriptions are required to operate your ADAS system. However, optional software updates,
									OEM programming packages, and advanced diagnostic features are available to expand functionality over
									time. These upgrades help you stay compliant with new vehicle models, maintain calibration accuracy,
									and keep your system performing at peak efficiency. We’re fully transparent about any optional costs
									before purchase, so there are no hidden fees.

									most major vehicle brands including GM, Ford, Toyota, BMW, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Tesla,
